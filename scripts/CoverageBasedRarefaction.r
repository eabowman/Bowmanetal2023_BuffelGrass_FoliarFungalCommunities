# This code was probably used in the following article for example.
# https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201789#supplementary-information

# Read in libraries, (maybe first two is not necessary)
library(tidyr); library(dplyr); library(vegan) 

# 95% sequence similarity read data (Abundance table. Row: samples, Column: OTUs)
# otu.data <- read_csv('E13-133.data/SitexSpecies_95sim.csv')

# 100% sequence similarity read data (Abundance table. Row: samples, Column: OTUs)
otu.data <- read_csv('E13-133.data/SitexSpecies_100sim.csv')

## Check samples read numbers and otu read numbers
comm.data <- otu.data[-1]
# Remove OTUs with less than 50 reads
comm.data <- comm.data[colSums(comm.data) > 50]
row.names(comm.data) <- otu.data$Sample

# make new data frame
otu.data <- data.frame(otu.data$Sample, comm.data[1:length(comm.data)])
